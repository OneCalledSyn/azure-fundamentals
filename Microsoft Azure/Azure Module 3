Azure Fundamentals

Core Cloud Services

How does Azure work? 
 -Private and public cloud platform
 -Virtualization: Separate tight coupling between a computer's hardware and OS using an abstraction layer called a 'hypervisor'
 -Hypervisor emulates all the functions of a physical computer in a VM, each hypervisor can run multiple VMs
 -Repeat on a large scale in Microsoft datacenters globally
 -Each rack has many servers that each have a hypervisor
 -Network switch provides connectivity to each rack
 -Each rack has one server which runs a special piece of software called a 'fabric controller'
 -All of the fabric controllers are connected to another piece of software called the 'orchestrator'
 -Users make requests through the orchestrator's web API on the UI of the Azure portal, and the orchestrator then handles those requests

Azure App Service: HTTP-based service that enables you to build and host many types of web-based solutions without managing infrastructure. For example, you can host web apps, mobile back ends, and RESTful APIs in several supported programming languages. Applications developed in .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python can run in and scale with ease on both Windows and Linux-based environments.
