Azure Fundamentals

Core Cloud Services - Azure architecture and service guarantees

Usually deploying a resource in Azure will necessitate selecting a region
Some services and VMs are only available in certain regions, and some need no region selection
Provides global reach with local presence

Azure Geographies
-Azure divides the world into geographies that are defined by geopolitical boundaries or country borders
-An Azure geography is a discrete market typically containing two or more regions that preserve data residency and compliance boundaries
-Allow customers with specific data residency and compliance needs to keep their data and applications close
-Ensure that data residency, sovereignty, compliance, and resiliency requirements are honored within geographical boundaries
-Fault-tolerant to withstand complete region failure through their connection to dedicated high-capacity networking infrastructure

Availability Zones
-Physicaly separate datacenters within an Azure region
-Each zone is made up of datacenters with independent power, cooling, and networking so if one goes down the rest still work
-Primarily used for VMs, managed disks, load balancer, and SQL databases
-Zonal service: pin the resource to a specific zone
-Zone redundant services: replicates automatically across zones

Region Pairs
-Each Azure region is paired with another region within the same geography but at least 300 miles away
-Replication of resources that are unlikely to be simultaneously affected by outages

Service Level Agreements
-Formals documents that define the standards Azure must meet for its customers
-Main components: Performance targets, uptime and connectivity guarantees, and service credits
-Composite SLA for different services combined together
 -Combined probability of failure higher than each individual SLA level
 
Improving App Reliability
-Provision resources according to workload requirements
-Resiliency: ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function
 -High availability and disaster recovery are two main components of resiliency
-When defining the architecture, perform Failure Mode Analysis (FMA) to identify possible points of failure and how each one will be responded to
