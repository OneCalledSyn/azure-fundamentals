Azure Billing: An Azure subscription is a logical container used to provision resources in Azure
	-Holds the details of all your resources like virtual machines (VMs), databases, and more
	-When you create an Azure resource like a VM, you identify the subscription it belongs to
	-As you use the VM, the usage of the VM is aggregated and billed monthly

	-Creating additional subscriptions can be useful for resource management
		-Separate environments, organize structure, billing, subscription limits, etc.
		-Subscriptions can be partitioned into invoice sections
