Azure Fundamentals

Predict Costs and Optimize Spending for Azure

Resources are always charged based on usage

De-allocating a VM is similar to turning off a physical computer

Azure usage rates and billing periods can differ between Enterprise, Web Direct, and Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) customers
	-Some subscription types also include usage allowances, which affect costs

Azure Billing Zones
	-Most of the time inbound data transfers (data going into Azure datacenters) are free
	-For outbound data transfers (data going out of Azure datacenters), the data transfer pricing is based on Billing Zones
	
Azure Pricing Calculator: allows you to input all the services and costs to get a reasonable estimate of price

Azure Advisor: provides recommendations on high availability, security, performance, and cost
	-Analyzes your deployed services and looks for ways to improve your environment across those four areas
	-Reduce costs by eliminating unprovisioned Azure ExpressRoute circuits
	-Buy reserved instances to save money over pay-as-you-go
	-Right-size or shutdown underutilized virtual machines
	
Azure Cost Management: free, built-in Azure tool that can be used to gain greater insights into where your cloud money is going
	-See historical breakdowns of what services you are spending your money on and how it is tracking against budgets that you have set
	-Set budgets, schedule reports, and analyze your cost areas

Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator: useful when beginning to migrate to the cloud
-Define on-premise infrastructure: servers, databases, storage, and networking
-Adjust cost assumptions for: Storage, IT labor, hardware, software, electricity, virtualization, datacenter, networking, databases

Azure subscriptions that have associated monthly credits (which includes trial accounts) have a spending limit to ensure you aren't charged once you have used up your credits

If you have VM workloads that are static and predictable, particularly ones that run non-stop all year long, using reserved instances is a fantastic way to potentially save up to 70-80% of the pay-as-you-go cost, depending on the VM size

Should provision connected resources that are bandwidth metered in the same region to reduce egress traffic between them

De-allocate VMs in off hours, especially for testing and development environments

Save on Licensing Costs

-Linux vs Windows: If the application doesnt depend on the underlying OS, consider which is cheaper
-Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server
-Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server: vCore
-BYOL (Bring Your Own License)
-Use constrained instance sizes for database workloads
