Azure Fundamentals

Control and organize resources with the Azure Resource Manager

Principles of Resource Groups: Logical container for resources deployed on Azure

-All resources must be in exactly one resource group
-Group by whatever fits business needs, such as logical grouping, life cycle grouping, or authorization grouping
-Guidelines and best practices:
 -Consistent naming conventions
 -Organizing principles

Tags: name-value pairs of text data that can be applied to resources and resource groups
-use policies to ensure that our resources have the tags that organize our resources
-mostly common sense stuff

RBAC: role based access control
 -Allow model: being assigned to a role allows you to perform specific actions
 -Best practices:
  -Only allow specific actions at a particular scope
  -Grant users the lowest level privilege they need to do their work
  -Use Resource Locks to make sure critical resources arent modified or deleted
	-Can be set to either 'Delete' or 'Read-only'
