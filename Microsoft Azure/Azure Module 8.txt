Azure Fundamentals

Azure Networking Options

Loosely coupled architecture: Components have little to no knowledge about the other components
-Each component simply needs to send and receive data, but must agree on standard form of communication
-Able to scale up or out component-wise

N-tier architecture: divides an app into two or more logical tiers
-Higher tier should be able to access lower tier, but not vice versa

Ecommerce web app 3 tier structure:
-Web tier: provides web interface to users through browser
-Application tier: runs the business logic
-Data tier: includes databases and other storage

Virtual Network: logically isolated network on Azure
-can be segmented into subnets
-Web/app/data tier each have a single VM on the same VN but different subnets

Network Security Group (NSG): allows/denies inbound traffic to Azure resources
-Basically a cloud-level firewall
-VM in the web tier allows inbound traffic on port 22 (SSH) and port 80 (HTTP)
 -Port 22 for direct connection to Linux systems over SSH

Load Balancer: distributes traffic evenly among each system in a pool
-Azure Load Balancer scales up to millions of flows for TCP and UDP applications

Azure Application Gateway
-Good option if all your traffic is solely HTTP
-Uses Azure Load Balancer at the transport level and URL-based routing (application layer load balancing)
-Benefits: Cookie affinity, SSL termination, Web app firewall, URL rule based routes, rewrite HTTP headers

Content Delivery Network: distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users 

Domain Name System (DNS): a method to map user-friendly names to IP addresses
-Phonebook of the internet

Latency: time it takes for data to travel over a network

Traffic Manager: use to route users to closest endpoint when you have scaled out to different regions
