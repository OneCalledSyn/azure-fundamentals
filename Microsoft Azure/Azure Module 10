Azure Fundamentals

Apply and monitor infrastructure standards with Azure Policy

Define IT compliance
-Azure Policy: Azure service that allows creation, management, and assignment of policies
-A policy definition expresses what to evaluate and what action to take. For example, you could ensure all public websites are secured with HTTPS, prevent a particular storage type from being created, or force a specific version of SQL Server to be used
-Common policy definitions: allowed storage account SKUs, allowed resource type, allowed locations, allowed VM SKUs, not allowed resource type
-Policy definition is represented as a JSON file
-To apply a policy, use Azure Portal or a command line tool by adding the Microsoft.OlicyInsights extension
-A policy assignment is a policy definition that has been assigned to take place within a specific scope
-Some policy effects: Deny, Disabled, Append, Audit, DeployIfNotExists

Initiative definition: a set or group of policy definitions to help track your compliance state for a larger goal
Initiative assignment: an initiative definition assigned to a specific scope

Enterprise Governance Management
-Access management occurs at the subscription level
-Azure Management Groups are containers for managing access, policies, and compliance across multiple Azure subscriptions

Defining standard resources with Azure Blueprints
-Enables cloud architects and central information technology groups to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implements and adheres to an organization's standards, patterns, and requirements
-Declarative way to orchestrate the deployment of various resource templates and other artifacts, such as:
	-Role assignments, policy assignments, Azure Resource Manager templates, resource groups
-The relationship between the blueprint definition (what should be deployed) and the blueprint assignment (what was deployed) is preserved
-Backed by globally distributed Azure Cosmos DB
-A blueprint is a package or container for composing focus-specific sets of standards, patterns, and requirements related to the implementation of Azure cloud services, security, and design that can be reused to maintain consistency and compliance

Microsoft Privacy Statement: Explains what data Microsoft possesses, how it's processed, and for what purpose

Microsoft Trust Center: information and details about how Microsoft implements and supports security, privacy, compliance, and transparency in all Microsoft cloud products and services

Service Trust Portal (STP): hosts Compliance Manager service 
-Used to publish audit reports and compliance related info relevant to Microsoft cloud services

Compliance Manager: workflow based risk assessment dashboard
