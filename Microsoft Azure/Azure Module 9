Azure Fundamentals

Security, Responsibility, and Trust in Azure

Security is a shared responsibility
-Infrastructure as a service: Azure handles physical datacenter/network/hosts, rest is on customer
-Platform as a service: Additionally Azure handles OS and partially network controls, application, and identity & directory infrastructure
-Software as a service: Azure has additional full responsibility for Network controls and application
-Regardless of deployment type, customer is always responsible for data, endpoints, accounts, and access management
 -MFA and RBAC
-Layers of security so that if one is breached, further exposure can be prevented
-Defense in depth layers (inner to outer):
	-Data
	-Application
	-Compute
	-Networking
	-Perimeter
	-Identity and access
	-Physical security
	
Azure Security Center: monitoring service that provides threat protection across all Azure services
-Provide security recommendations
-Apply required security to new services as they come online
-Security assessments to identify risks
-Malware blocking with machine learning
-Two tiers, free and standard
-Incident response flow: Detect, Assess, Diagnose, Stabilize, Close
	-Security Center used for the first three

Identity and Access
-Authentication: process of establishing the identity of a person or service looking to access a resource
-Authorization: process of establishing what level of access an authenticated person or service has
-Both AuthN and AuthZ are managed by Azure Active Directory
-Azure AD provides:
	-AuthN
	-Single Sign On (SSO): one ID and password to access multiple applications
	-Application management
	-Business to business identity services (B2B)
	-Business to customer identity services (B2C)
	-Device management
	
Single Sign On
-More identities = greater risks
-One login for everything simplifies security model

Multifactor Authentication
-Require two or more elements for full authentication:
		-Something you know, something you possess, something you are

Service principal: an identity that can be used by a service or application
-Can be assigned roles
-Managed identity can be immediately created for any supported Azure service

Role Based Access Control: identities are mapped to roles directly or through group membership
Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is an add on to further assist with overseeing role resources

Encryption: process of making data unreadable and unusable to unauthorized viewers
-Symmetric encryption: same key to encrypt and decrypt the data
-Asymmetric encryption: uses a public key and a private key
	-Either key can encrypt, but need the paired key to decrypt
	-Used for Transport Layer Security (TLS) in HTTPS and data signing

Encryption at rest: 
-Data at rest has been stored on a physical medium

Encryption in transit:
-Data actively moving from one location to another
-Can be done at several different layers
	-Encrypting at application layer prior to sending over a network
	-Setup secure channel like a VPN and transmit at the network layer
	
Encryption on Azure

Encrypt Raw Storage: Azure Storage Service Encryption for data at rest, auto encrypts before storing
Azure Disk Encryption: encrypt Windows and Linux virtual machine disks
Encrypt databases: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for Azure SQL Database and Azure Data Warehouse
	-Default provides a unique encryption key for each instance of SQL Server 
	-Can also do Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) with keys stored in Azure Key Vault 

Azure Key Vault: protect secrets
-Secrets management, key management, certificate management, store secrets backed up by hardware security models (HSM)
Benefits: centralized application secrets, securely stored secrets and keys, monitor access and use, simplified administration of application secrets, integrate with other Azure services

Azure Certificates

-x.509 v3: can be signed by a trusted cert authority or can be self-signed 
-Should only use self-signed when developing or testing your cloud services
-Two primary purposes in Azure:
	-Service certificates are used for cloud services
		-Automatically deployed to the VM that is running an instance of your role
		-Upload certs to Azure portal
		-Associated with a specific cloud service
	-Management certificates are used for authenticating with the management API

Azure Key Vault: can also store certs
-Make certifications in the Vault
-Store and manage certs without interaction with private key material
-Manage cert lifecycles

Protect Your Network

Internet Protection: identify all resources that are allowing inbound network traffic of any type, and then ensure they are restricted to only the ports and protocols required		

Firewall: a service that grants server access based on the originating IP address of each request
-For inbound perimeter protection, use Azure Firewall or Azure Application Gateway or Network virtual appliances (NVAs)

Azure DDoS Protection to block denial of service attacks

For communication between VMs, use Network Security Groups to restrict unnecessary communications

Protect Shared Documents

-Microsoft Azure Information Protection: classify and protect documents and emails by applying labels

Azure Advanced Threat Protection: identifies, detects, and investigates threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions 
-Components: Azure ATP portal for overview, ATP sensor for monitoring domain traffic, ATP cloud service

Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL): introduces security and privacy considerations all throughout the phases of the development process
-Provide training: Secrity is everbody's job
-Define security requirements: Legal/industry reqs, internal standards, coding practices, known threats, etc.
-Define metrics and compliance reporting
	-Track key performace indicators (KPI)
-Perform threat modeling
-Establish design requirements
-Define and use cryptography standards
-Manage security risks from third party companies
-Use approved tools
-Perform static & dynamic analysis security testing
-Perform penetration testing
-Establish a standard incident response process
